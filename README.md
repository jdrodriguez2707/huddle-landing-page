## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Font library
- [Font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Icon library

### What I learned

- How to add and edit background images:

```css
body {
  background-color: var(--primary-background-color);
  background-image: url("../images/bg-mobile.svg");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: 100%;
}
```

- How to set the same hover effect to two elements to activate it at the same time:

```css
.icon-border:hover {
  border-color: var(--secondary-color);
}

.icon-border:hover .fa-brands {
  color: var(--secondary-color);
}
```
